    question: "How do I become a VIP/VIP+?",
    answer: `VIP Status is automatically granted once you create an account with us. With this status you receive 10 points per $1 spent that can be used to make reward vouchers ranging from $5-100. Points are earned by making purchases, reviewing your purchases, liking us on social media, and more. 

            VIP+ Status is automatically granted once you reach 5,000 points in your account. With this status you receive 15 points per $1 spent. Unfortunately if you account is inactive for more than a year, you may loose your VIP+ status and go back to a VIP status.`,
