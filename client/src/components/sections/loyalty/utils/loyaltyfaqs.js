    answer: (
      <p>
        <span className="bolded">VIP Status</span> is automatically granted once
        you create an account with us. With this status you receive 10 points
        per $1 spent that can be used to make reward vouchers ranging from
        $5-100. Points are earned by making purchases, reviewing your purchases,
        liking us on social media, and more.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="bolded">VIP+ Status</span> is automatically granted
        once you reach 5,000 points in your account. With this status you
        receive 15 points per $1 spent. Unfortunately if you account is inactive
        for more than a year, you may loose your VIP+ status and go back to a
        VIP status.
