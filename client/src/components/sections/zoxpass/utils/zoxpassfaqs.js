    question: "How do I access ZOXPASS?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        With an active monthly subscription status to our Mystery Pack, Pearl
        Club, or String Club.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>Access does not apply for ZOXBlog subscriptions.</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you already were holding an active subscription at the time of the
        launch (December 15th, 2021) then you would automatically be a part of
        ZOXPASS, no need to sign up for another subscription or for ZOXPASS
        itself.

    question: "Can I combine my ZOXPASS discount with other discounts?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Sadly you are unable to stack discounts on our site. So if any discounts
        are applied at checkout, the automatic ZOXPASS discount will be removed.
