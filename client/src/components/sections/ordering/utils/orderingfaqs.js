    question: "Can you make me a personalized Zox?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        I'm so sorry but at this point in time we can not offer personal ZOX. We
        totally understand there are certain meanings or designs that you or
        loved ones are drawn to. Please be sure to check out our{" "}
        <span className="bolded">Shop</span> page and you may just be able to
        find something similar to what you're looking for.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have an idea for a ZOX design, please join{" "}
        <span className="bolded">ZOX Idea Factory</span> and post it in there.
        We have a ton of amazing artists who are always looking for new ideas.

    question: "Why won't my discount apply to my order?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        1. You cannot use multiple discounts at the same time.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Some discounts only apply to specific items and will not apply if the
        item is not in your cart.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. You have already used the discount on a previous order so it is no
        longer valid.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. You can not discount subscriptions as they process through a separate
        platform for checkout.
        <br />
        <br />
        We hope this helps! :)

    question: "Help, I ordered the wrong item! What should I do?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        I'm so sorry to hear that! If you reach out to us quickly enough via
        live chat or the contact form at the top of this page we will try our
        best to adjust that order in time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, we are unable to guarantee that we can make the
        adjustments before the order ships out due to the high volume of
        messages we receive and how quickly orders are going out everyday. We
        will give it our best efforts though! :)

    question: "How long will my order take to ship?",

      <p>
        We do everything we can to get orders processed and shipped out as soon
        as they come in, which is usually 1-3 business days but it may take up
        to 4-6 days if we have a large influx of orders.

        <i>Business days are considered Monday through Friday.</i>

    question: "I'm unhappy with my first order, what should I do?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Oh no, we're so sorry to hear that! We actually have a Happiness
        Guarantee on your very first order. Here's how that works:
        <br />
        <br />
        If this is your first time ordering and you're not happy with the
        quality, fit, or overall look of your first ZOX, please pass it along to
        a friend and we'll give you a full refund on it. If you have additional
        unworn Straps, Imperials or Strings you'd like to return within 15 days
        of purchase, you can fill out the return form at the bottom of this page
        and we'll get you taken care of right away.
        <br />
        <br />
        Happiness Guarantee cannot be used when your initial purchase was used
        in conjuction with our Share the Love program. Happiness Guarantee does
        not cover slow shipping times to foreign countries. If you are unhappy
        with the ship time, you can pay to return your Straps and the refund
        will be processed as soon as we receive your return.

        reach out to us with a photo of the damaged/defective ZOX and we'll get
        it sorted for you as quickly as possible.

    question: "IMPORTANT Order Over 90 Days Old",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Unfortunately when an order is over 90 days old, our system is then no
        longer able to issue a refund. If there are any issues that exceed that
        timeframe such as orders not being delivered, damaged items, etc. we
        will not be able to issue a refund but will instead need to issue you a
        store credit for your the initial amount that was paid.
