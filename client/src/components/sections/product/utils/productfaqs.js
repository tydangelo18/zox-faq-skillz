    question: "What are straps/singles made of?",
    answer: `

    ZOX are buttery-soft elastic wristbands made made from recycled plastic water bottles!

    Though the latex is typically not visible (each strand of latex is encased in polyester), you may experience discomfort if you're allergic to latex. In that case, we'd recommend collecting our imperial+ or metlets which are latex-free.`,

    question: "When will a sold out product come back?",
    answer: `

    It depends on the collection type! The rarity level will show under 'Details' on the product page. Every strap/single we make is limited edition, so once it is fully sold out, it is gone for good.

    You can check out our collectors guide here to learn more about rarity.`,

    question: "Can I get my ZOX wet?",
    answer: `You sure can! Zox are made of a special type of elastic that holds up very well in water; even after getting 'em wet the color will be super vibrant and awesome. We do definitely recommending ordering the ZOX to fit as well as possible Once in a while we see Straps that are in water non-stop, or ZOX that are too large get a little warped, as elastic tends to do over time, but unless you're a fish you probably have nothing to worry about. If you are a fish and have learned how to read, I'd love to hear from you! üôÇ

    question: "Why didn't my strap come with a golden ticket?",
    answer: `If you do not receive a golden ticket with a gold stitched strap (#001-100), we did not forget it and there was not any sort of mistake on our end. Golden tickets have only been added in for the past couple of years and older gold stitched straps will not come with them.

    Some items may also not include golden tickets, such as blog straps and monster month.`,
