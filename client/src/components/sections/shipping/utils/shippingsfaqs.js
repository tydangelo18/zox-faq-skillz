    question: "How much is shipping?",
    answer: `We've worked hard to find the best rates. We offer free shipping on all orders of wristbands of $35+ to nearly every country. 
            If your order is less than that, then your shipping fees will be calculated at checkout based upon your location.

            Hoodies are only available in a limited number of countries. Most are free, but some are a $10 extra charge to help us cover our costs.

            Duties may be due at the border for some international shipments and are not covered in the purchase price our our products.`,

    question:
      "Help! The wrong shipping address is on my order, what should I do?",
    answer: `If you reach out to us quickly enough via live chat or the contact form at the top of this page we will try our best to adjust that shipping address in time.

            Unfortunately, we are unable to guarantee that we can make the adjustment before the order ships out due to the high volume of messages we receive and how quickly orders are going out everyday. We will give it our best efforts though and provide options for what can be done if the order has gone out and has the wrong address on it. :)

            If the package has already been shipped out or delivered to wrong address on file (and cannot be changed). We have to charge shipping costs for the reshipment the original costs has been already been charged on the original shipment.`,

    question: "Where is my order if there are no tracking updates?",
    answer: `

    If your order just shipped out it will typically take between 24-72 hours during business days (Monday-Friday) before you see updates.

    If your order was showing tracking updates and stops showing them. Wait until it has been your anticipated shipping time, then please reach out to us and 
    we’ll get that taken care of for you. 

    For international orders, if the last updates shows ‘Processing Completed At Origin’ 
    it typically it takes a few business days to update as arrived in your country. It can take up to 2 weeks before scanning in as arrived in your country. 
    If you any concerns, let us know and we can take a look at what we have seen lately for your country.`,

    question: "My package shows as delivered but it's not here. What can I do?",
    answer: `I'm so sorry to hear that your order has been marked as delivered but hasn't shown up quite yet. Try to not stress out too much quite yet, 
            this has happened a few times in the past. If your order doesn't show up after 72 hours of being marked as delivered, 
            please don't hesitate to reach out and we'd be happy to help.

            Here's some super helpful steps we've used in the past to track down a missing package:

            Checking with anyone who has access to your mailbox. Check with your normal postal delivery person. 
            My last recommendation would be to check with your neighbors. 
            From time to time addresses are misread and neighbors receive mail and sometimes don't even realize it.`,

    question: "Will I have to pay customs/duties fees?",
    answer: `If you selected 'Delivered Duties Paid' as your shipping method and are being charged a customs fee, 
            please accept the package and reach out to us with an image of the customs receipt and we will refund you for any fees you were charged by 
            applying it to a previous order or through providing a store credit.

            If you choose to go with our 'Free Shipping - Duties May Be Due At Border' option and are charged a fee by your countries customs office, 
            you can opt to have the package sent back to us for a refund or store credit minus the shipping fee to cover our costs to ship your order. `,

    question: "IMPORTANT International Addresses Must Be In English",
    answer: `I'm so sorry but sadly at this point in time, our system is unable to read and print addresses that are input into the system in any other characters besides English. 
            If you enter your address with other characters your package will not be able to be delivered and will have to be reshipped or potentially refunded.`,

    question: "IMPORTANT Shipping Delays COVID-19",
    answer: `Unfortunately during this time, the average processing time and shipping time have both gone up. We are doing our very best to be able to efficiently ship out all orders however, the delivery of the actual order may be delayed at this time due to local restrictions based on your shipping address.

            We are back to shipping to all countries worldwide. Some delays may occur due to COVID-19 and restrictions in your country.
