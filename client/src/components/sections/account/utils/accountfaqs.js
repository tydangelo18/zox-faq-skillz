    question: "Why did I stop receiving ZOX emails?",
    answer: `That’s not good! Typically, we’ve found that this issue is caused by emails going to your spam folder. 
            If that’s not the case, your email may have bounced from your email provider. This usually happens when your inbox is full, your email provider was down, or the message was too large for your inbox.

            If you need to resubscribe to emails, you can do so at this here.`,

  {
    question: "Why can't I log in?",
    answer: `If you have lost or forgotten your password, don't worry, it's very easy to fix. All you will need to do is go here and click the 'Forgot Password' 
            link. That should bring you to a page to enter your email and a message will be sent over to set a new password.
            If you have tried the above step and had an error saying you do not have an account. That would mean that you did 
            not create an account prior to ordering or after you ordered. That is very easy to fix as well, to create an account with any previous order history you will need to click here.
            Make certain you use the same email address that you initially used for your order and it should sync correctly for you and 
            have your points automatically added in.`,

    question: "How do I change my billing information?",
    answer: `This is done during check out, if you need to update your payment information/method. Please be sure to change it during checkout and save it for the future as this should help you check out faster.
            This will not update your subscription information and will need to be done so under 'Manage Subscriptions'.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How do I update my default address?",
    answer: `This is a very simple process to do. You will need log into your account, click 'My Account', click 'View Addresses', then 'Add a New Address.' When you fill it out make sure to click the box to set it as your new default.
            
            This will not update any active subscription addresses and you will need to do that under 'Manage Subscriptions'.`,
  },
  {
    question: "I filled out the contact form, how soon will you respond?",
    answer: `This all depends on how busy we are. It typically takes up to 24 hours for us to respond to everyone depending on our workload. We typically respond to emails Monday-Friday, so if you email in on Friday night, the soonest you'll receive a response is Monday.
            
            Also, it's important to keep in mind that our system is set to show oldest tickets first. If you email in while waiting to follow up, your ticket will be marked as brand new and won't show as close to the top as it would have.`,
