      <p>
        We're so sorry to hear that you're needing to start the return process
        with us. We've done our very best to make it as easy as possible. All
        you need to do is click <span className="bolded">here</span>, fill in
        your information and the reason that you're creating the return. From
        there, if your return is accepted, it should only take a few business
        days at most to hear back from us with instructions on how to return it.
