    question: "Overview of Monthly Subscriptions",
    answer: `

      Here you will find a breakdown of each subscriptions price, when you will be charged, and what it includes.
  
      Being apart of any of these will give you access to the Secret Stash.
  
      Pearl Club - 1st of the month - $25 -  Pearls are monthly limited edition Straps that come packed along side a matching enamel pin in a special magnetic collectors box. They are only available via membership which is limited to just 1,000 people. Pearls are the only Straps with logos stitched in metallic pearl white.
  
      String Club - 9th of the month- $25 - Strings were created to be the interchangeable piece of our Imperial Hoodie collections. Using the same patent-pending magnetic clip as our Imperials, Strings allow you to change the look of your hoodie in seconds. Each String comes in an acrylic storage container with engraving on the side. Like Imperials, they're also numbered on the material itself - you'll find your String's serial number at the very center. The String Club provides you with two color-coordinated, unreleased Strings every month.
  
      Mystery Club - Based on when you first order - $25 - Mystery Packs are our way of incorporating a game of chance into ZOX. Each pack contains 3 completely random Straps that range from in stock to sold-out. On top of that, there are over 100 different designs that are 100% exclusive to Mystery Packs, including the rarest Straps we make: Black Stars. These beauties have a rarity level of Grail and only have 100 pieces made. We massively revamped Mystery Packs in June 2019 to be the absolute best experience we could possibly make. This includes the following:
  
      1. Now over 250 different designs mixed in, most with a rarity of Exclusive or better.
      2. New Carbon stitched Black Stars with redeemable Black Star Cards.
      3. Redeemable Gold cards included with nearly all gold stitched Straps found in Mystery Packs
      4. Beautiful 6 - Strap mini-collections with matching Moonstones for the first 200 people to finish a set
      5. Extra-rare matching Moonstone Strap for the first 200 people to finish each mini-collection.`,

    question: "How do I update my address on my subscription?",
    answer: `

    If you need to update your address, make sure you do it for your subscription as well. You can do so by logging in, going to 'My Account', clicking 'Manage Subscriptions', and then from there, you can update your address.

    We are not responsible for subscriptions that are not updated correctly and shipped out to an old address, after your order has been processed we can not make changes on our end. If this happens, we would highly recommend reaching out to your local post office or your old address to see about getting ahold of your package.`,

  {
    question: "How do I cancel/edit a subscription?",
    answer: `If you'd like to edit/cancel your subscription, you can sign into your account on ZOX.LA. Once you're on your account page, you'll need to click the link that says 'Manage Subscriptions' and you can cancel, update your address, change billing information, and pause your subscription from there.`,
