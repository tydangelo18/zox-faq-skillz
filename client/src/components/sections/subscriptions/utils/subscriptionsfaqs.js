        Pearl Club - 1st of the month - $25 - Pearls are monthly limited edition
        Straps that come packed along side a matching enamel pin in a special
        magnetic collectors box. They are only available via membership which is
        limited to just 1,000 people. Pearls are the only Straps with logos

        String Club - 9th of the month- $25 - Strings were created to be the
        interchangeable piece of our Imperial Hoodie collections. Using the same
        patent-pending magnetic clip as our Imperials, Strings allow you to
        change the look of your hoodie in seconds. Each String comes in an
        acrylic storage container with engraving on the side. Like Imperials,
        they're also numbered on the material itself - you'll find your String's
        serial number at the very center. The String Club provides you with two
        color-coordinated, unreleased Strings every month.
